## Preparations
>1. A complete SMS message consists of **SMS signature** and **SMS body**. You can set different message body templates based on business needs, and then combine the signature and body to form a final display. **SMS signature + SMS body = final display**.
>2. Our review will be completed within half a work day after the SMS signature and template are submitted. If necessary, you can set a mobile number and email address to receive the notification of SMS message content audit for this project.
