## 8.INDEMNIFICATION  补偿

8.1.	If a third party makes a claim against either You or us (“Recipient” which may refer to You or us depending upon which party received the Material), that any information, design, specification, instruction, software, service, data, hardware, or material (collectively, “Material”) furnished by either You or us (“Provider” which may refer to You or us depending on which party provided the Material) and used by the Recipient infringes the third party’s intellectual property rights, the Provider, at the Provider’s sole cost and expense, will defend the Recipient against the claim and indemnify the Recipient from the damages, liabilities, costs and expenses awarded by the court to the third party claiming infringement or the settlement agreed to by the Provider, if the Recipient does the following: 

a.notifies the Provider promptly in writing, not later than 30 days after the Recipient receives notice of the claim (or sooner if required by applicable law);
b.gives the Provider sole control of the defense and any settlement negotiations; and 
c.gives the Provider the information, authority and assistance the Provider needs to defend against or settle the claim.  
如果第三方以您或腾讯云（“提供方”，指提供材料的一方，可以是您也可以是腾讯云）提供的和接受方使用的任何信息、设计、技术规范、指令、软件、服务、数据、硬件、或材料（统称“材料”）侵犯其知识产权为由向您或腾讯云（“接受方”，指接受材料的一方，可以是您也可以是腾讯云）索赔，则提供方在接受方做到以下事项的前提下，自费为接受方辩护，并补偿法庭所判决的、接受方向主张侵权的第三方履行的补偿、债务、成本和费用或自费进行提供方同意的和解：
a.  在接受方收到索赔通知后的三十(30)日内（或者适用法律要求的更短期限内），及时以书面形式通知提供方；
b.  给予提供方进行辩护及任何和解谈判的完全控制权；以及
c.  给予提供方进行索赔辩护或和解时所需要的信息、授权和协助。

8.2.	If the Provider believes or it is determined that any of the Material may have violated a third party’s intellectual property rights, the Provider may choose to either modify the Material to be non-infringing (while substantially preserving its utility or functionality) or obtain a license to allow for continued use, or if these alternatives are not commercially reasonable, the Provider may end the license for, and require return of, the applicable Material and refund any unused, prepaid fees the Recipient may have paid to the other party for such Material.  If such return materially affects our ability to meet obligations under the relevant order, then we may, upon 30 days prior written notice, terminate the order.  If such Material is third party technology and the terms of the third party license do not allow us to terminate the license, then we may, upon 30 days prior written notice, end the Services associated with such Material and refund any unused, prepaid fees for such Services.
如果提供方认为或已确定材料的任何内容可能侵犯了第三方的知识产权，则提供方可选择修改材料，使之不构成侵权（但在实质上保留其效用或功能），或获得允许继续使用的许可，或者如果这两种选择不是合理的商业方式，则提供方可终止相应材料的许可并要求召回材料，同时退还接受方就该材料已经向提供方支付的任何未使用的预付费用。如果材料退回实质性地影响腾讯云履行相关订单项下服务的能力，则腾讯云将有权选择提前三十(30)天发出书面通知，终止该订单。如果上述材料是第三方技术，并且第三方许可条款不允许腾讯云终止许可，则腾讯云可提前30天发出书面通知，终止与上述材料相关的服务，并退还就上述服务已支付的但尚未使用的费用。

8.3.	The Provider will not indemnify the Recipient if the Recipient (a) alters the Material or uses it outside the scope of use identified in the Provider’s user or program documentation or Service Specifications, or (b) uses a version of the Material which has been superseded, if the infringement claim could have been avoided by using an unaltered current version of the Material which was made available to the Recipient. The Provider will not indemnify the Recipient to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon any Material not furnished by the Provider. We will not indemnify You to the extent that an infringement claim is based on Third Party Content or any Material from a third party portal or other external source that is accessible or made available to You within or by the Services (e.g., a social media post from a third party blog or forum, a third party Web page accessed via a hyperlink, marketing data from third party data providers, etc.).  
如果接受方(a)对材料进行修改，或超出提供方的用户说明书、程序说明书或服务说明的范围进行使用，或(b)使用已被代替的材料版本，且如果使用向接受方提供的未经更改的当前版本材料本可以避免侵权索赔，提供方将不对接受方予以补偿。如果侵权索赔是基于并非由提供方提供的任何材料导致的，提供方将不对接受方予以补偿。如果侵权是由于任何第三方内容或通过服务提供或可访问的第三方网站或其它外部资源的材料导致的（例如，源自第三方博客或论坛的社交媒体文章、通过超链接访问的第三方网页、第三方数据提供商提供的营销或市场数据等），腾讯云将不对您提供任何补偿。

8.4.	This Section 8 provides the parties’ exclusive remedy for any infringement claims or damages.  
本第 8 条规定了对任何侵权索赔或损害补偿的唯一补救措施。

You agree that if You are in default under this Agreement, You may not use those Services ordered.  
如果任何一方违反本协议或您订单的实质性条款，且未能在接到非违约方发出的书面违约通知后的六十(60)天内予以纠正或与非违约方就纠正计划达成一致，则违反协议方构成违约，非违约方可终止本协议及发生违约情形的本协议的订单。如区域内的相关法律及国家政策发生实质性变化且允许外资企业（包括腾讯云的分包商）直接从事本协议及您订单所规定的任何形式的云服务的运营及提供，腾讯云可在提前六（6）个月向您发出书面通知后终止本协议及您订单。如果腾讯云根据前文终止了订单，则您必须在三十(30)天内付清终止前发生的所有费用，以及此类订单项下的服务仍未支付的所有金额及相关税费和费用。除不付款的情况外，非违约方可以自行决定同意延长30天的期限，以便违约方能继续尽合理的努力纠正其违约行为。您同意，如果您违反此协议，您不得使用订购的服务。
